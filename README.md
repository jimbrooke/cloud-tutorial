# Cloud Technology Tutorial

This tutorial is in 3 parts, one for each workshop.  Each part is stored on a separate git branch.

It is recommended that you clone the code for each workshop into a fresh folder.  For example "

```
git clone git@github.com:jimbrooke/cloud-tutorial.git -b workshop-1 workshop-1
```

(Note that you really do need 'workshop-1' twice).
